# 💬 Advice App – React 

The Advice App is a simple and responsive React application that fetches and displays random pieces of advice from the public Advice Slip API. Each time the user clicks the “Get Advice” button, a new inspirational or humorous quote is displayed.

The purpose of this project was to learn how to fetch data from external APIs using fetch(), manage asynchronous data, and update the UI dynamically in React. It also reinforced concepts like state updates and component re-rendering with user interaction.
